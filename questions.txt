Q1: What did you do to test your implementation and what was each test intended to verify?

// TODO

Q2: What functionality is missing from the router implementation we asked you to complete?  We mentioned TTLs, but what else?

// TODO

Q3: Is it possible to arping from one host to another in this network?  Why or why not?

// TODO

Q4: ARP is a very common protocol that maps from IP->MAC.  Mechanisms for mapping the other direction MAC->IP are much less common.  Why do you think that is?

Q5: Hybrid routers/switches exist in the real world.  For instance, imagine we have a 3-port L2/3 switch, where ports 1&2 are on the same Ethernet network and port 3 is an uplink to the Internet.  In this case, the switch might have 2 MAC addresses, XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (facing ports 1&2) and YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY (facing port 3), and a single IP address Z.Z.Z.Z (facing port 3).

Ports 1&2 would function exactly like a learning switch, but if a frame arrives with dstMac XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, it would kick it up to Layer 3 processing.  Similarly, if packet arrives at port 3, it might broadcast it out ports 1&2.

Briefly sketch out pseudocode for the data plane operation of such a switch.  This doesn't need to be in P4 format.  C++/Python-like logic is fine.
